TwentyEleven for Mediawiki
==========================

Copyright 2011 Roberto Teixeira and the Wordpress Contributors

This is a port of the TwentyEleven Wordpress theme for Mediawiki. This post
is by no means complete and contains several hardcoded values.

It was done to allow me to continue using Mediawiki for specific pages on
my website, which is mostly based on wordpress. But I thought some people
might also enjoy this at least as a starting point for whatever they
want to do ;)

Roberto.
